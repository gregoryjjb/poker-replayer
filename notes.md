Texas holdem 
No real variations that matter

Variables to input at the beginning:
- Number of opponents (2-10)
- Position of button
- Ante (optional, usually 10% of big blind)
- Small blind (left of button)
- Big blind (left of small blind)
- Everyone's stack sizes
- Reads
  - What is your impression of that particular opponent?
  - Loose, aggressive, passive, etc ... these are semi-standardized
  - Alternatively freeform text
- Known hole cards, including yours

As the game progresses:

- Pot size (computed from action)

Nice to haves:
- Side pots
- Universal ante
- Hide/show hole cards
- Covert pot to big blinds
- Animations
- Sounds that represent actions
